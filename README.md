# ember-adminlte-components

A set of components and AdminLTE dependencies for Ember projects.

This package helps using AdminLTE in Ember projects:

* Pulls AdminLTE and it dependencies from npm (bower not needed)
* Exposes a set of components with overall page design and blocks

The project is in an early stage of development after being extracted
from our internal Ember applications using AdminLTE.
